            // Answer: 
            /*
            HTTP requests and responses are how data is exchanged between a client (such as a browser) and a server (such as a web server). 
            A client sends an HTTP request to the server, specifying a method (or verb) that indicates the desired action to be performed 
            on a resource. The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response, containing a status code that indicates whether 
            the request was successful or not, and optionally a body that contains the requested data or an error message.
            The most common HTTP methods (or verbs) are: 
            GET: Requests a representation of the specified resource.
            POST: This method is used to create or update a resource on the server.
            PUT: This method is used to update or overwrite a resource on the server.
            DELETE: This method is used to remove a resource from the server.
            PATCH: This method is used to modify a resource on the server without replacing it entirely.

            // Checkpoint 4.2 What is the difference between callbacks, then-catch vs await-try-catch? When should you use one over the other
            // Answer: 
            /*
             Callbacks, then-catch, and await-try-catch are different ways of handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. 
             Asynchronous operations are those that do not block the execution of the code, such as fetching data from an API, 
             reading a file, or setting a timer.

             Promises (then-catch) are objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. 
             Promises have a then method that takes two callbacks, 
             one for success and one for failure, and returns another promise.
             
             Async/await (await-try-catch) is a syntactic sugar that makes working with promises easier and more intuitive. 
             Async/await allows us to write asynchronous code as if it were synchronous, using the await keyword to pause the execution 
             until the promise is resolved, 
             and the async keyword to mark a function that returns a promise.

             The choice of which method to use depends on your preference and the situation, 
             but generally speaking, async/await is the most modern and preferred way of handling asynchronous operations, 
             as it makes the code more concise, clear, and elegant. However, async/await is not supported by all browsers, 
             so you may need to use a transpiler like Babel to convert it to compatible code. You may also need to use callbacks 
             or promises in some cases where async/await is not applicable, such as event listeners, generators, or array methods.
